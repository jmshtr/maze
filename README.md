# Maze Game

This is a simple text-based maze game implemented in Python. The player navigates through a maze represented by a grid of characters, trying to reach the end point while avoiding obstacles.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Run the Python script using `python maze.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate the maze.
5. Enter `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` to move the player.
6. Reach the end point of the maze to win the game.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) to move the player.
- Avoid walls (`#`) and navigate through open spaces (` `) to reach the end.

## Features

- **Dynamic Maze**: The maze updates dynamically to reflect the player's movement.
- **Enhanced UI**: The console screen is cleared after each move for better visibility.
